# **Errors/Exceptions**
___
> Errors and exceptions are nearly synonymous. 
> 
> An **Error** can be identified & corrected during compile time. There are **syntax errors** or **exceptions**.
> 
> An **Exception** can only be identified during runtime and can be handled with `try` and `except` statements.
> This allows for exceptions to be thrown without crashing the program. 

## - Built-in Exceptions
Python already contains a lot of built-in exception types, for common issues like dividing by zero `ZeroDivisionError`,
entering the wrong data type `TypeError`, or trying to import a missing file `FileNotFoundError`.

Other common built-in exceptions:

 `ValueError` `AssertionError` `KeyboardInterrupt` `OverflowError` `RuntimeError` `OverflowError`

A full list of built-in exceptions can be found [HERE](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/exceptions.html#exception-hierarchy).
